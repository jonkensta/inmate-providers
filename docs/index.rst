IBP pymates
===========

Welcome to the documentation for the IBP :py:mod:`pymates`,
the IBP inmate lookup utility.
:py:mod:`pymates` is a Python module that finds Texas inmates;
it does this by doing the following:

    1) Query the `TDCJ`_ and `FBOP`_ websites with given search parameters.
    2) Record errors and aggregate the results.
    3) Return results along with a list of any errors that occurred.

.. _TDCJ: https://offender.tdcj.texas.gov/OffenderSearch/start.action;jsessionid=95ce98aac78b3c74ae4325cbed6a
.. _FBOP: https://www.bop.gov/mobile/find_inmate/byname.jsp

This project makes use of the following third-party Python modules:

    * :py:class:`BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML responses
    * :py:class:`nameparser.parser.HumanName` for parsing names
    * :py:mod:`aiohttp` for issuing async HTTP requests
